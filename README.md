🔊 Web Application | 🎙 Live Voice Recording | 🧠 ML Powered | 🌐 Flask Web App

This project is a Machine Learning–based gender detection system that predicts whether a speaker is Male or Female using their voice.
The system extracts audio features using Librosa, processes them with a trained SVM model, and provides a real-time prediction through an interactive web interface.
